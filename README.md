# Primary Task:
## Develop a very basic EMS (Employee Management System) wherein you have a form asking all the relevant details of the Employee e.g. Name, Age, Department, Blood group,Address and Contact number.

### ● When you submit the form, all the details get saved in the local storage of the browser.
### ● Once the details are saved you fetch them and display them in a table.
### ● There should be an 'Edit' and 'Delete' functionality for each row in the table to edit
various attributes of the employee. The edit/delete functionality should edit/delete only
the row on which the edit/delete button is clicked.
### ● Everytime you fill the form and submit, the new row gets appended to the table. This way
you get a table holding employee records that can be manipulated as per the
requirement above.

##Notes:
### ● Code should have proper comments and indentation.
### ● Maintain a proper folder structure.
### ● Code should be modular.
### ● Please follow the ideal design approach, the interface and aesthetics would matter.

## Important: You have to do this using Angular (Any version > 8) / React (16+) following coding
best practices/standards.
